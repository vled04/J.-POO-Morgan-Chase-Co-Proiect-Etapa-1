# J.-POO-Morgan-Chase-Co-Proiect-Etapa-1 2024
Description
This project involves developing a simplified e-banking system using Java, simulating core banking functionalities. The system will manage user accounts, transactions, and reports, ensuring safe and secure operations. It will support basic banking operations like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and generating financial reports. Additionally, it will handle user authentication and transaction monitoring to prevent fraud.

The project will follow object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and incorporate design patterns to ensure a modular, scalable system.

Features
Account Management: Create, manage, and delete user accounts.
Transactions: Support deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts.
Currency Exchange: Handle currency conversions with configurable exchange rates.
Reports: Generate transaction and balance reports.
Security: Ensure data protection and secure operations.
Commands
The system interacts with users through commands that simulate the key banking operations. These commands will allow users to perform actions such as adding accounts, performing transactions, and viewing reports.
